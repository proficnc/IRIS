# Summary

3D Robotics have been strong adovcates of open source collaboration and their IRIS+ and MADE FOR SOLO projects are testimony to that. 

If that wasn't enough, in all their awesomeness they have decided to give back to the community by giving away the files for the IRIS+ for free!

Also Included here.... Kirby Downey has released an optimised version of the arms and legs which are up to 50% lighter and require less support.

Just download the 2 ZIP files and you'll have everything.   The individual STL files are just for viewing etc as they are identical to whats in the .ZIPs

Original Locations for these part/s were behind a registration "wall", so I've copied them here for you.    The locations are:
